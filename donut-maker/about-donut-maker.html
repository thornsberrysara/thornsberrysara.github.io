          Donut maker is a fun clicker game that can get very addicting. The
          goal of the game is to get as many donuts possible. Don't worry, you
          can give your clicking finger a break by purchasing auto clicks. This
          will handle the clicking for you. You can purchase as many as you
          want, and if you're feelin' frisky, continue clicking your mouse for
          even more donuts! Additionally, you should purchase donut multipliers
          to make your donuts worth more than 1. You can never have too many
          donuts, right?
