          Fred the Baker was born in 1871 in New York City. He didn't have many
          friends in school, and he was bullied quite often because he would
          always have icing on his shirt and sprinkles in his hair. On his way
          to school everyday, he would pass by a bakery. He planned to put in
          his application once he turned 14. But as a child, he would just
          volunteer to clean the floors and take out the trash. He wanted to
          learn how to make donuts so badly, but he knew he needed to wait.
          Finally, on Fred's 14th birthday, he woke up at 7:00 am to hand in his
          application, and he was hired immediately. He learned how to make the
          best donuts in town, and even came up with a few of his own recipes.
          His signature donut was a vanilla cake donut with pink icing and
          colorful sprinkles. "Donut Maker" was inspired by Fred and his famous
          donut. Thank you Fred for your service.
