      <h4>
        Hey, I'm Sara. I'm a graduate of We Can Code IT, a full-stack software
        development bootcamp in Columbus, Ohio. While I'm able to work my magic
        on the back-end, I'm super passionate about front-end development and
        design. When I can catch a break from writing code, I'm either working
        on old-school Japanese cars or playing video games.
